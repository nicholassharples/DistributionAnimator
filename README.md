# DistributionAnimator
Animating probability distributions in R with ggplot, to help visualise paramter changes.

Generates ggplot images for
the discrete distributions
  binomial
  poisson
the continuous distributions
  uniform
  normal
  exponential
  chi-square
  gamma
  beta

The parameters describing these distributions are varied to produce images for an animation.

The R code calls ffmpeg to stitch these together into a animated mp4.
